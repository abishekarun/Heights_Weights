## Heights Weights Dataset

In this mini project, we try to work on the basic heights weights dataset and apply all regression models in caret library to predict the weight.

The final R file is [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Heights-Weights-Dataset/blob/master/height-weight.R) for this project.

The resources that helped me are:

+ [caret Documentation](https://topepo.github.io/caret/)
+ [caret models](https://rdrr.io/cran/caret/man/models.html)
+ [Web Scraping in R](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/beginners-guide-on-web-scraping-in-r-using-rvest-with-hands-on-knowledge/)
